## Author’s Note

From early childhood, I carried a heightened sensitivity to injustice. When someone was mistreated, I felt it physically, almost instinctively. As a child, I often stepped in to defend others — and learned early that standing on the side of truth is rarely rewarded.

I was also deeply sensitive. When I was about seven years old, my parents decided to give our dog to my grandparents. I cried for a week. Later, when I visited them, the dog was gone. I was told she had run away. Many years later, I learned the truth: she had been given away because having a dog in the apartment was considered inconvenient.

That moment became a quiet fracture — a loss I carried silently for decades, only fully understanding its weight much later. From that point on, I became incapable of tolerating lies or hypocrisy. I learned that solitude is less destructive than living inside a false narrative.

As I grew older, this inner tension shaped my path. I became a journalist, working where religion and politics intersect — a space where truth is often unwelcome. I was born and worked in Kyiv, where I publicly defended the truth about the Church — not opinions, not ideology, but lived reality.

Even before the war, Russian-speaking people in Kyiv increasingly faced pressure, ridicule, and social hostility. The language of my childhood gradually became a reason for suspicion. Speaking it openly, or defending the Church, placed a person outside what was considered acceptable. Silence became safer than honesty.

The Church itself, and those who spoke in its defense, were subjected to attacks, threats, and systematic humiliation. This atmosphere did not merely shape my work — it reshaped my inner world.

When the war began, my family and I were forced to flee — not only from rockets, but from years of accumulated hatred. Today, I live in Germany.

What is happening between Russia and Ukraine remains an open wound in my heart. I always believed we were brothers — one family. What is unfolding now feels like a tragedy of fratricide. A slow, unbearable tearing apart that leaves behind grief, helplessness, and a profound loneliness.

My creative work is born from this silence.  
From loss that has no language.  
From the refusal to accept injustice, lies, war, and hatred as normal.

This work does not explain.  
It does not persuade.  
It does not accuse.  

It remains present.
